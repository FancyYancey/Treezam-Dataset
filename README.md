# Treezam-Dataset
It's Shazam for trees.  Haven't you ever looked at a tree and wondered what kind of tree it was?  
No, not really.  
Okay, when I look at trees, I want to know what kind of tree it is. 

This repo contains the dataset to train a Computer Vision model to detect and identify different types of trees based on their leaves. 
Inspired by the episode "Nashville" from Master of None.
